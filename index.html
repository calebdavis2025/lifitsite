      <h3>3. User Content</h3>
      <p>You retain ownership of content you submit to the Services. By posting content, you grant LiFit a worldwide, royalty-free license to host, store, reproduce, and display that content solely for operating and improving the Services. You are responsible for the legality of the content you share.</p>
      <h3>4. Subscriptions & Payments</h3>
