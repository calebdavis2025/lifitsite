        <small>Effective: January 1, 2025</small>
      </div>
      <h3>LiFit Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p class="sub">This Privacy Policy explains how LiFit collects, uses, and safeguards information when you access our mobile applications, websites, and related services (collectively, the “Services”). By using the Services you consent to the practices described below.</p>
      <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>We collect the information you provide directly, including account details, workout logs, photos, and messages. We also gather device identifiers, app analytics, and approximate location data when you enable location-based features. Some information may be collected automatically through cookies or similar technologies.</p>
      <h3>2. How We Use Information</h3>
      <p>We process your information to deliver core features (such as workout tracking, social sharing, and cloud backup), personalize recommendations, communicate updates, and maintain the security of the Services. We may aggregate and de-identify information to improve product performance and develop new offerings.</p>
      <h3>3. When We Share Information</h3>
      <p>We only share data with vendors or service providers who help us operate the Services (for example, cloud hosting, analytics, or customer support). These partners are contractually required to protect your information. We may also disclose information if required by law, to prevent fraud, or with your consent.</p>
      <h3>4. Data Retention & Security</h3>
      <p>We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the Services and meet legal obligations. We apply reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your information. No system is perfectly secure, so we encourage you to use strong passwords and keep your account credentials confidential.</p>
      <h3>5. Your Choices</h3>
      <p>You can update certain profile fields, notification preferences, and sharing settings within the app. You may request deletion of your account by contacting <a href="mailto:lifit.liftfit@gmail.com" style="color: var(--accent);">lifit.liftfit@gmail.com</a>. Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have additional rights, such as accessing, correcting, or exporting your data.</p>
      <h3>6. Children</h3>
      <p>The Services are not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your region) and we do not knowingly collect information from children. If we learn that a child has provided data, we will delete it promptly.</p>
      <h3>7. Changes</h3>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Effective” date above will always reflect the latest revision. Material changes will be communicated through the app or via email where required.</p>

      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, excluding its conflict-of-law rules. Any disputes will be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Travis County, Texas.</p>
      <h3>9. Changes to the Terms</h3>
      <p>We may update these Terms periodically. If changes are material, we will notify you through the Services or via email. Continued use of the Services after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
